## Intro

iNDIEVOX open datasets, you can play machine learning algorithms with these datasets.

## Datasets

### Music Valence-Arousal Datasets
    * Valence-Arousal Dataset Song ID List

## Algorithms and Feature Extraction

We play algorithms like [Gaussian SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) and [Ridge Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization) to train data from the datasets. The algorithm library we use is [Fuku-ML](https://github.com/fukuball/fuku-ml), and feature extraction library is [PyAudio](https://github.com/jleb/pyaudio).

## Made From These Datasets
